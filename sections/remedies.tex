\subsection{Introduction to Contract Damages}

\subsubsection{Restatement Second \S\ 344: Purposes of Remedies}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Expectation}: puts promisee in the position he would have been in if 
    the contract had been \emph{performed}.
    \item \textbf{Reliance}: puts promisee in the position he would have been in 
    if the contract had \emph{not been made}.
    \item \textbf{Restitution}: restores to the promisee any benefit he 
    conferred to the promisor.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{\emph{Hawkins v. McGee}}

The appropriate measure of damages is the difference between (1) performance 
of the contract as promised and (2) actual performance. In this case, damages 
are equal to the difference between the promised ``perfect hand'' and the 
actual state of the hand after the operation.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The plaintiff, Hawkins, had scar tissue on his hand that resulted 
    from a severe burn from contact with an electrical wire. Dr. McGee removed 
    the scar tissue and grafted some skin from Hawkins's chest onto his hand. 
    Hawkins ended up in the hospital for three months and lost the use of his 
    hand. Also, the new tissue apparently ``filled his hand with a `matted' 
    and `unsightly growth'---presumably hair.''\footnote{Casebook p. 194.}
    \item Hawkins sued for breach of an alleged warranty of the success of the 
    operation. The trial court found for Hawkins. Hawkins also brought a 
    negligence claim, which the trial court dismissed on nonsuit.
    \item After trial, the defendant moved to set aside the verdict as 
    excessive. The trial court ordered the verdict set aside unless Hawkins 
    would remit all damages above \$500. He refused. Exceptions on both sides 
    were transferred to the Supreme Court.
    \item Part 1: was there a contract, and if so, what were its terms?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The parties agreed that McGee had said that after the operation, 
        Hawkins would be in the hospital for three or four days, and after 
        going home, he would have a ``perfect hand'' for three or four 
        days.\footnote{Casebook p. 190.} The court held that this alone would 
        not have established a contract guaranteeing that Hawkins would 
        \emph{definitely} be home after three or four days or could go to work 
        a few days after being home. It was only an indication of the probable 
        outcome of the surgery. But such a contract would have been 
        established if Dr. McGee has promised a ``\emph{hundred per cent} 
        perfect hand.''
        \item But the question of the wording of the promise was irrelevant 
        because Dr. McGee had ``repeatedly solicited'' the opportunity to 
        perform the operation. He \enquote{sought an opportunity to 
        `experiment on skin grafting'}. Because these words constituted an 
        inducement of consent, it was reasonable to conclude that the parties 
        had entered into a contract.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Part 2: what damages were appropriate?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The jury instructions requested damages for (1) pain and 
        suffering and (2) ``ill effects of the operation on the plaintiff's 
        hand.''\footnote{Casebook p. 191.}
        \item The appropriate damages would have been the difference between 
        (1) the promised ``perfect hand'' and (2) the state of the hand after 
        the operation. Pain and suffering were part of the bargain, and 
        physical harm to the plaintiffs hand would be subsumed into the 
        rule of damages the court adopted here.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Part 3: were McGee's requested jury instructions appropriate?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item No. They were ``loosely drawn'' and ``extremely 
        misleading.''\footnote{Casebook p. 193.}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Cooter \& Eisenberg, ``Damages for Breach of Contract''}

``The purpose of the social institution of bargain is to create joint value 
through exchange.''\footnote{Casebook p. 203.} Protecting the expectation 
interest maximizes the value of contracts.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Should we prefer reliance or expectation damages?
    \item Sometimes, the difference doesn't matter. For instance, in a 
    perfectly competitive market, reliance damages will equal expectation 
    damages because the contract price will equal the forgone price the 
    promisee could have contracted with a third party. But it matters if 
    market conditions are far from perfectly competitive.
    \item Traditionally, courts were united in the view that expectation 
    damages were appropriate. ``In fact, prior to the 1930's the reliance 
    principle operated only in a covert manner.''\footnote{Casebook p. 200.}
    \item The reliance principle expanded after \S\ 90 of the Restatement 
    Second (1932) and Fuller and Perdue, \emph{The Reliance Interest in 
    Contract Damages} (1934).
    \item Should the reliance principle expand contract liability or reduce it 
    by substituting reliance liability for expectation liability?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Reliance liability introduced a tort conception of liability.
        \item There is not a clear rationale for expectation damages.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item So: what should happen when reliance and expectation damages 
    diverge?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \emph{Efficiency}: the value created by a contract.
        \item \emph{Distribution}: how a contract's value is divided among the 
        parties.
        \item \emph{Nonprice} terms of a contract make it possible to control 
        a contract's efficiency.\footnote{Casebook p. 201.}
        \item \emph{Price} terms make it possible to control distribution.
        \item Damages should be fair and efficient. ``~.~.~.~we take as a 
        theorem that a damage rule is both fair and efficient if it 
        corresponds to the terms that rational parties situated like the 
        contracting parties would have reached when bargaining under ideal 
        conditions.''\footnote{Casebook p. 202.}
        \item Would rational parties prefer reliance or expectation damages?
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \emph{Administrative effects}: reliance is difficult to 
            measure and prove, while expectation damages are based on the 
            known contract price, rather than the speculative forgone price.
            \item \emph{Incentive effects}: if performance or alternative 
            performance become more profitable than performance of the 
            original contract, the promisor has to decide whether or not to 
            breach. If there are only reliance damages, he will rationally 
            breach. But if there are expectation damages, he will have to 
            account for the promisee's loss of his share of the value of the 
            contract. In other words, he will not internalize the value of the 
            performance to the promisee.\footnote{Casebook p. 202--03.}
            \item ``Thus expectation damages create efficient incentives for 
            the promisor's performance, while reliance damages do not, unless 
            they are identical to expectation damages.''
            \item Expectation damages also give the promisee more confidence 
            in planning.
