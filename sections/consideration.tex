\section{Consideration}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Consideration is the thing that locks up a contractual 
    relationship---``[s]omething (such as an act, a forbearance, or a return 
    promise) bargained for and received by a promisor from a 
    promiee~.~.~.~''\footnote{Black's Law.}
    \item Why do we require consideration?
    \item Can you sell a bottle of Gatorade for \$10,000? Yes---courts are 
    hesitant to interfere with private transactions (with a few exceptions).
    \item Spectrum of ways a contract can be established:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Objective}: forms, labels, seals, magic words.
        \item \textbf{Subjective}: intent---e.g., the intent to make a 
        promise.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Consideration traditionally has two elements:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Mutual assent.
        \item Recognized consideration.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Donative Promises, Form, and Reliance}

\subsubsection{Simple Donative Promises}

Made for affective reasons, usually informal, and not demonstrably relied 
upon.\footnote{Casebook p. 6.}

\paragraph{\emph{Dougherty v. Salt}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A boy's aunt gave him a promissory note for \$3,000, payable at her 
    death or before. The aunt died. The boy's guardian brought an action 
    against the aunt's estate to recover the promised money.
    \item The jury found for the plaintiff. The trial judge set aside the 
    verdict and dismissed the complaint. The appellate court reversed and 
    reinstated because it held that the promissory note was valid 
    consideration.
    \item The New York Court of Appeals (Cardozo) reversed, holding that the 
    note was ``the voluntary and unenforceable promise of an executory 
    gift.''\footnote{Casebook p. 7.} The note was inadequate consideration in 
    this context because paper does not make a donative promise enforceable.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Restatement Second \S\ 1: Definition}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item ``A contract is a promise or a set of promises for the breach of 
    which the law gives a remedy, or the performance of which the law in some 
    way recognizes as a duty.''
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Restatement Second \S\ 17: Requirement of a Bargain}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item ``~.~.~.~a contract requires a bargain in which there is a 
    manifestation of mutual assent to the exchange and a consideration.''
    \item But, there are many exceptions.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Restatement Second \S\ 71: Requirement of Exchange; Types of 
Exchange}

\begin{itemize}
    \item (1) Consideration must be bargained for. 
    \item (2) A performance or return promise is ``bargained for'' if sought and given in exchange.
    \item (3) Performance can be an act, forbearance, or creation, 
    modification, or destruction of a legal relation.
    \item (4) Performance may be given to another person.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Restatement Second \S\ 79: Adequacy of Consideration; Mutuality 
of Obligation}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item If the consideration requirement is met, there are no requirements 
    of gain/loss, equivalence in value, or ``mutuality of obligation.''
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{On the Restatement Second}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Samuel Williston, Reporter for the Restatement First: contract law 
    is ``a set of axioms that were deemed to be self-evident, together with a 
    set of subsidiary rules that were purportedly deduced from the 
    axioms.''\footnote{Casebook p. 8.}
    \item Arthur Corbin, Consultant to the Restatement Second: father of 
    ``modern contract law.''\footnote{Casebook p. 8.}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Consideration}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Consideration is giving something and getting something in return. 
    Both parties get something they want from the other.
    \item Mere acceptance is not consideration, but at some point acceptance 
    becomes an act that qualifies as consideration.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The \textbf{Tramp Example}: I'll call the store and have two 
        suits ready for you. You go to the store and find out I just kidding. 
        There's no act there. But what if I make you drive to a store in San 
        Francisco? Is that an act that constitutes consideration? I got what I 
        wanted (for you to go to the store) and you thought you were getting 
        what you wanted (new clothes).
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Courts generally do not consider the adequacy of consideration.
    \item Two conceptions: broad and narrow.
    \item \emph{Broad}: ``consideration'' refers collectively to the things 
    that make contracts legally enforceable---e.g., bargain or 
    reliance.\footnote{Casebook p. 8.}
    \item \emph{Narrow}: ``consideration'' is the same thing as ``bargain.'' 
    The Restatement Second adopts this approach, known as the \textbf{bargain 
    theory of consideration}.
    \item The bargain theory of consideration creates two kinds of distortion:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \emph{Terminological}: many other elements besides bargain can 
        make a contract enforceable. Therefore, ``under the terminology of the 
        Restatement Second, a promise needs consideration to be enforceable 
        unless it does not need consideration to be 
        enforceable.''\footnote{Casebook p. 9.}
        \item \emph{Substantive}: the bargain theory presumes that all 
        nonbargain promises are unenforceable. It does not allow the law to 
        develop other means of making promises enforceable.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Gifts}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The common law distinguishes between gifts and promises to make 
    gifts. A promise to make a gift is not enforceable. \emph{Dougherty}.
    \item A \textbf{deed of gift} (or \textbf{inter vivos document of 
    transfer}) transfers ownership via a written instrument.\footnote{Casebook 
    pp. 9--10.}
    \item Another way to make a gift is for the owner to declare herself a 
    \textbf{trustee} of her property for the benefit of another. The trustee 
    retains legal title but the beneficiary receives beneficial 
    ownership.\footnote{Casebook p. 10.}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Donative Promises}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Why make a donative promise, rather than wait and give the gift 
    later?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Instincts vary. The promisor might think she has better judgment 
        right now than she will in the future.
        \item The promisor wants to derive satisfaction from the promisee's 
        gratitude.
        \item \textbf{Beneficial reliance}: the promisee can rely on the 
        promise to her benefit---e.g., knowing that her Aunt will pay for 
        college, a niece decides to finish high school, rather than look for a 
        paying job.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The ``basic fault line'' in classical contract law was between 
    bargain promises (enforceable) and gratuitous promises (unenforceable).
    \item Should contract law be based on the moral belief that breaking 
    promises is unethical, or should it promote utilitarian goals like 
    ``compensating injured promisees and increasing social 
    wealth''?\footnote{Casebook p. 11.}
    \item Lon Fuller introduced \textbf{substantive} and \textbf{process} 
    bases for enforcing promises.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The two process bases are evidentiary (making sure a promise 
        has actually been made) and cautionary (preventing inconsiderate 
        action by the promisor).
        \item Simple donative promises are problematic on both bases. They 
        raise problems of proof (evidence may be uncertain) and 
        deliberativeness (the promisor is likely to be emotionally involved 
        with the promisee).
        \item Substantive reasons for enforcing donative promises include 
        compensating the promisee's disappointment (a form of injury), move 
        assets from the wealthy to the less wealthy, and increase the 
        likelihood of beneficial reliance. But these substantive bases are 
        open to question.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Conditional Donative Promises}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item In a bargain promise, the condition is the \textbf{price} of the 
    promise---e.g., I'll give you \$20 if you mow my lawn.
    \item In a donative promise, the condition is the \textbf{means} to make 
    the gift---e.g., I'll buy you a car if you pick one that costs less than 
    \$15,000. 
    \item We have to rely on a ``reasonable interpretation'' to determine 
    whether a condition is a means or a price.\footnote{Casebook p. 13.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{The Element of Form}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We often look for an official indication of a valid 
    agreement, like wax seals, but the requirement has mostly evaporated.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Von Mehren, ``Civil-Law Analogues to Consideration: An Exercise 
in Comparative Analysis''}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item French, German, and common law systems recognize four policies that 
    lead them to treat a transaction as unenforceable:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Evidentiary}: Evidentiary security---protecting against 
        manufactured evidence and dealing with insufficient proof.
        \item \textbf{Cautionary}: Safeguarding the individual against his own 
        rashness.
        \item \textbf{Channeling}: Signaling to make sure that the promisor 
        knows the promise is enforceable.
        \item \textbf{Deterrent}: Unwillingness to enforce contracts of 
        ``suspect or marginal value.''\footnote{Casebook pp. 13--14.}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Channeling Function of Contract-Law Rules}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Von Mehren's channeling policy assumes actors know contract 
    law---but must don't. So, this policy only applies to rules that actors 
    are likely to know. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{\emph{Schnell v. Nell}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Zacharias Schnell's wife Theresa agreed to pay \$200 each to Nell and 
    the two Lorenzes on her death. After she died, Schnell agreed with the 
    three claimants to pay out the promised money over three years. In 
    exchange, the three claimants gave him one cent. Now, Schnell wants to 
    back out of the agreement.
    \item Schnell argued that there was no consideration because his wife did 
    not own any property and therefore could not make such a promise. The 
    lower court sustained a demurrer against Schnell.
    \item The question was whether the contract ``express[ed] a consideration 
    sufficient to give it legal obligation, as against Zacharias 
    Schnell.''\footnote{Casebook p. 15.}
    \item The court considered three bases for consideration:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The claimants promised to pay Schnell one cent.---Although 
        courts generally do not evaluaate the adequacy of consideration, this 
        exchange---one cent for \$200---is too unconscionable to 
        sustain. (``Even in traditional times, courts were not willing agents 
        of absurdity or oppression.''---Berring.)
        \item Mr. Schnell bore love and affection to his late wife, and ``she 
        had done her part, as his wife, in the acquisition of the 
        property.''\footnote{Casebook p. 15.}---Invalid because these are past 
        considerations and have no bearing on Schnell's promise to the three 
        claimants.
        \item Mrs. Schnell wished to give the money to the three 
        claimants.---Invalid because she had no property of her own.
