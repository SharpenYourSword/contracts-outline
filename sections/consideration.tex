\section{Consideration}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Consideration is the thing that locks up a contractual 
    relationship---``[s]omething (such as an act, a forbearance, or a return 
    promise) bargained for and received by a promisor from a 
    promiee~.~.~.~''\footnote{Black's Law.}
    \item Why do we require consideration?
    \item Can you sell a bottle of Gatorade for \$10,000? Yes---courts are 
    hesitant to interfere with private transactions (with a few exceptions).
    \item Spectrum of ways a contract can be established:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Objective}: forms, labels, seals, magic words.
        \item \textbf{Subjective}: intent---e.g., the intent to make a 
        promise.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Consideration traditionally has two elements:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Mutual assent.
        \item Recognized consideration.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Donative Promises, Form, and Reliance}

\subsubsection{Simple Donative Promises}

Made for affective reasons, usually informal, and not demonstrably relied 
upon.\footnote{Casebook p. 6.}

\paragraph{\emph{Dougherty v. Salt}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A boy's aunt gave him a promissory note for \$3,000, payable at her 
    death or before. The aunt died. The boy's guardian brought an action 
    against the aunt's estate to recover the promised money.
    \item The jury found for the plaintiff. The trial judge set aside the 
    verdict and dismissed the complaint. The appellate court reversed and 
    reinstated because it held that the promissory note was valid 
    consideration.
    \item The New York Court of Appeals (Cardozo) reversed, holding that the 
    note was ``the voluntary and unenforceable promise of an executory 
    gift.''\footnote{Casebook p. 7.} The note was inadequate consideration in 
    this context because paper does not make a donative promise enforceable.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Restatement Second \S\ 1: Definition}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item ``A contract is a promise or a set of promises for the breach of 
    which the law gives a remedy, or the performance of which the law in some 
    way recognizes as a duty.''
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Restatement Second \S\ 17: Requirement of a Bargain}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item ``~.~.~.~a contract requires a bargain in which there is a 
    manifestation of mutual assent to the exchange and a consideration.''
    \item But, there are many exceptions.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Restatement Second \S\ 71: Requirement of Exchange; Types of 
Exchange}

\begin{itemize}
    \item (1) Consideration must be bargained for. 
    \item (2) A performance or return promise is ``bargained for'' if sought and given in exchange.
    \item (3) Performance can be an act, forbearance, or creation, 
    modification, or destruction of a legal relation.
    \item (4) Performance may be given to another person.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Restatement Second \S\ 79: Adequacy of Consideration; Mutuality 
of Obligation}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item If the consideration requirement is met, there are no requirements 
    of gain/loss, equivalence in value, or ``mutuality of obligation.''
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{On the Restatement Second}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Samuel Williston, Reporter for the Restatement First: contract law 
    is ``a set of axioms that were deemed to be self-evident, together with a 
    set of subsidiary rules that were purportedly deduced from the 
    axioms.''\footnote{Casebook p. 8.}
    \item Arthur Corbin, Consultant to the Restatement Second: father of 
    ``modern contract law.''\footnote{Casebook p. 8.}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Consideration}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Consideration is giving something and getting something in return. 
    Both parties get something they want from the other.
    \item Mere acceptance is not consideration, but at some point acceptance 
    becomes an act that qualifies as consideration.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The \textbf{Tramp Example}: I'll call the store and have two 
        suits ready for you. You go to the store and find out I just kidding. 
        There's no act there. But what if I make you drive to a store in San 
        Francisco? Is that an act that constitutes consideration? I got what I 
        wanted (for you to go to the store) and you thought you were getting 
        what you wanted (new clothes).
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Courts generally do not consider the adequacy of consideration.
    \item Two conceptions: broad and narrow.
    \item \emph{Broad}: ``consideration'' refers collectively to the things 
    that make contracts legally enforceable---e.g., bargain or 
    reliance.\footnote{Casebook p. 8.}
    \item \emph{Narrow}: ``consideration'' is the same thing as ``bargain.'' 
    The Restatement Second adopts this approach, known as the \textbf{bargain 
    theory of consideration}.
    \item The bargain theory of consideration creates two kinds of distortion:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \emph{Terminological}: many other elements besides bargain can 
        make a contract enforceable. Therefore, ``under the terminology of the 
        Restatement Second, a promise needs consideration to be enforceable 
        unless it does not need consideration to be 
        enforceable.''\footnote{Casebook p. 9.}
        \item \emph{Substantive}: the bargain theory presumes that all 
        nonbargain promises are unenforceable. It does not allow the law to 
        develop other means of making promises enforceable.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Gifts}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The common law distinguishes between gifts and promises to make 
    gifts. A promise to make a gift is not enforceable. \emph{Dougherty}.
    \item A \textbf{deed of gift} (or \textbf{inter vivos document of 
    transfer}) transfers ownership via a written instrument.\footnote{Casebook 
    pp. 9--10.}
    \item Another way to make a gift is for the owner to declare herself a 
    \textbf{trustee} of her property for the benefit of another. The trustee 
    retains legal title but the beneficiary receives beneficial 
    ownership.\footnote{Casebook p. 10.}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Donative Promises}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Why make a donative promise, rather than wait and give the gift 
    later?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Instincts vary. The promisor might think she has better judgment 
        right now than she will in the future.
        \item The promisor wants to derive satisfaction from the promisee's 
        gratitude.
        \item \textbf{Beneficial reliance}: the promisee can rely on the 
        promise to her benefit---e.g., knowing that her Aunt will pay for 
        college, a niece decides to finish high school, rather than look for a 
        paying job.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The ``basic fault line'' in classical contract law was between 
    bargain promises (enforceable) and gratuitous promises (unenforceable).
    \item Should contract law be based on the moral belief that breaking 
    promises is unethical, or should it promote utilitarian goals like 
    ``compensating injured promisees and increasing social 
    wealth''?\footnote{Casebook p. 11.}
    \item Lon Fuller introduced \textbf{substantive} and \textbf{process} 
    bases for enforcing promises.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The two process bases are evidentiary (making sure a promise 
        has actually been made) and cautionary (preventing inconsiderate 
        action by the promisor).
        \item Simple donative promises are problematic on both bases. They 
        raise problems of proof (evidence may be uncertain) and 
        deliberativeness (the promisor is likely to be emotionally involved 
        with the promisee).
        \item Substantive reasons for enforcing donative promises include 
        compensating the promisee's disappointment (a form of injury), move 
        assets from the wealthy to the less wealthy, and increase the 
        likelihood of beneficial reliance. But these substantive bases are 
        open to question.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Conditional Donative Promises}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item In a bargain promise, the condition is the \textbf{price} of the 
    promise---e.g., I'll give you \$20 if you mow my lawn.
    \item In a donative promise, the condition is the \textbf{means} to make 
    the gift---e.g., I'll buy you a car if you pick one that costs less than 
    \$15,000. 
    \item We have to rely on a ``reasonable interpretation'' to determine 
    whether a condition is a means or a price.\footnote{Casebook p. 13.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{The Element of Form}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We often look for an official indication of a valid 
    agreement, like wax seals, but the requirement has mostly evaporated.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Von Mehren, ``Civil-Law Analogues to Consideration: An Exercise 
in Comparative Analysis''}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item French, German, and common law systems recognize four policies that 
    lead them to treat a transaction as unenforceable:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Evidentiary}: Evidentiary security---protecting against 
        manufactured evidence and dealing with insufficient proof.
        \item \textbf{Cautionary}: Safeguarding the individual against his own 
        rashness.
        \item \textbf{Channeling}: Signaling to make sure that the promisor 
        knows the promise is enforceable.
        \item \textbf{Deterrent}: Unwillingness to enforce contracts of 
        ``suspect or marginal value.''\footnote{Casebook pp. 13--14.}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Channeling Function of Contract-Law Rules}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Von Mehren's channeling policy assumes actors know contract 
    law---but must don't. So, this policy only applies to rules that actors 
    are likely to know. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{\emph{Schnell v. Nell}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Zacharias Schnell's wife Theresa agreed to pay \$200 each to Nell and 
    the two Lorenzes on her death. After she died, Schnell agreed with the 
    three claimants to pay out the promised money over three years. In 
    exchange, the three claimants gave him one cent. Now, Schnell wants to 
    back out of the agreement.
    \item Schnell argued that there was no consideration because his wife did 
    not own any property and therefore could not make such a promise. The 
    lower court sustained a demurrer against Schnell.
    \item The question was whether the contract ``express[ed] a consideration 
    sufficient to give it legal obligation, as against Zacharias 
    Schnell.''\footnote{Casebook p. 15.}
    \item The court considered three bases for consideration:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The claimants promised to pay Schnell one cent.---Although 
        courts generally do not evaluaate the adequacy of consideration, this 
        exchange---one cent for \$200---is too unconscionable to 
        sustain. (``Even in traditional times, courts were not willing agents 
        of absurdity or oppression.''---Berring.)
        \item Mr. Schnell bore love and affection to his late wife, and ``she 
        had done her part, as his wife, in the acquisition of the 
        property.''\footnote{Casebook p. 15.}---Invalid because these are past 
        considerations and have no bearing on Schnell's promise to the three 
        claimants.
        \item Mrs. Schnell wished to give the money to the three 
        claimants.---Invalid because she had no property of her own.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

    \item % TODO 21-23
    ~\\\\\\\\\\\\
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Reliance}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A moral obligation to keep a promise is generally insufficient to 
    establish a legal obligation.
    \item Lawmakers should also consider social policy and experiential 
    concerns (e.g., problems of proof).
    \item Injury from reliance is a moral and policy reason for enforcing 
    promises.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{\emph{Kirksey v. Kirksey}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The defendant, plaintiff's brother in law, invited the plaintiff and 
    her family to come live at his house, offering her living space and land 
    to tend. She abandoned her property in the country to come live with him. 
    He let her live comfortably in the house for two years. Then, he put her 
    in a house, ``not comfortable,'' in the woods, and then made her leave.
    \item The lower court found for the plaintiff for \$200.
    \item The judge writing the opinion for the Supreme Court of Alabama 
    believed that the ``loss and inconvenience'' she suffered justified the 
    award, but the majority believed the offer was a ``mere gratuity.'' 
    Reversed.\footnote{Casebook pp. 24--25.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Restatement Second \S\ 90}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item ``A promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce 
    action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and 
    which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can 
    be avoided only by enforcement of the promise. The remedy granted for 
    breach may be limited as justice requires.''
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Estoppel in Pais and Promissory Estoppel}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Under classical contract law, only a bargain was a consideration. 
    Donative promises were not enforceable, even if the promisee relied on the 
    promise. \emph{Kirksey}.\footnote{Casebook p. 25.}
    \item \emph{Ricketts}: a man promised his granddaughter \$2,000 so she 
    would not have to work anymore. She quit her job. The man died. The 
    granddaughter successfully brought suit. The court avoided the question of 
    whether reliance constituted consideration. Instead, reliance estopped the 
    man's estate from pleading a lack of consideration.
    \item \textbf{Estoppel in pais}: if A made a statement and B foreseeably 
    relied on that statement, A is estopped from denying the statement's 
    truth. Based on a \emph{statement of fact}.
    \item \textbf{Promissory estoppel}: a promise is binding if the promisee 
    reasonably relied in it. See Restatement Second \S\ 90. Based on a 
    \emph{promise}.
    \item Both are instances of a broader \textbf{``reliance principle''}: 
    ``When one person, A, uses words or actions that he knows or should know 
    would induce another, B, to reasonably believe that A is committed to take 
    a certain course of action, and A knows or should know that B will incur 
    costs if A doesn't take action, A should take steps to ensure that if he 
    doesn't take the action, B will not suffer a loss.''\footnote{Casebook p. 
    27.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Promissory Estoppel Problem}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item An uncle promises his nephew \$50,000 to buy a business. The nephew 
    buys the business with his own money. The uncle dies before depositing the 
    promised money. The executor of the uncle's estate refuses to recognize 
    the nephew's claim.
    \item Can the nephew base an action on:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Deceit?
        \item Estoppel in pais?
        \item A promise made enforceable by unbargained-for reliance?
        \item A promise supported by a bargained-for consideration?
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Promissory Estoppel: \emph{Feinberg v. Pfeiffer Co.}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Facts:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 1910: Feinberg began working for Pfeiffer.
        \item 1947: Still working for Pfeiffer, now in more senior positions.
        \item December 27, 1947: the company resolved to raise her salary to 
        \$400/month and offer a lifetime retirement pay of \$200 per month 
        (but with the hope that she would continue working).
        \item June 30, 1949: Feinberg retired and began collecting her monthly 
        payments.
        \item Spring 1956: the company's new ownership refused to continue 
        sending the monthly retirement checks.
        \item April 1, 1956: the company sent its final check, for \$100. 
        Feinberg refused it and brought suit to recover her full monthly 
        retirement checks.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The trial judge held for Feinberg and awarded \$5,100.
    \item Pfeiffer raised two peripheral arguments on appeal:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The court erroneously allowed evidence that at the time of 
        trial, Feinberg could not seek employment because she was suffering 
        from cancer.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Held: this was not the basis for the trial court's decision.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item There was insufficient evidence to support the court's finding 
        that (1) Feinberg would not have quit unless she relied on the monthly 
        retirement checks and (2) Feinberg did in fact rely on the checks 
        after retiring.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Held: the lower court properly credited Feinberg's testimony 
            that she relied on the checks.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The key issue was whether Feinberg had a right to recover her 
    retirement checks on the basis of a legally binding contractual 
    obligation.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Pfeiffer: the company's decision to give the retirement checks 
        was a mere promise to make a gift. Donative promises are not 
        enforceable unless supported by consideration. The only possible 
        consideration here was a reward for past service, which is not valid. 
        Further, Feinberg's position was at-will.
        \item Feinberg: agreed that a promise based on past services would not 
        constitute valid consideration, but (1) she continued to work for a 
        year and a half after the company's resolution and (2) she based her 
        decision to retire on reliance on the monthly check.
        \item Court: 
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Feinberg's first contention, that she continued to work 
            after the resolution, does not constitute valid consideration 
            because that was not a condition of the agreement.
            \item But Feinberg's second argument, that she relied on the 
            promise, was valid. The promise met the Restatement Second \S\ 90 
            requirements for promissory estoppel (in fact, one of the 
            Restatement illustrations involves retirement annuities).
            \item Affirmed.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Distinguishing \emph{Feinberg}: \emph{Hayes v. Plantations 
Steel Co.}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Plantations Steel told Hayes it would ``take care'' of him upon his 
    retirement, but there was no mention of an actual sum. It gave a first 
    payment ``as a token of appreciation'' and implied that the payments would 
    continue annually.
    \item Later owners discontinued the payments. Hayes brought suit.
    \item The key distinction from \emph{Feinberg} is that the company's offer 
    of annuities was not an inducement to retire, because Hayes had given 
    notice of retiring several months earlier. He did not rely on the 
    company's promise because nothing about the promise changed his behavior. 
    Therefore, the promise did not meet the requirements for promissory 
    estoppel.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Remedies and Consideration}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item To what extent should a promise be enforced?
    \item Two types of \textbf{injury}:\footnote{Casebook p. 35.}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Reliance interest}: the promisee is worse off than he 
        would have been if the promise had not been made. \textbf{Reliance 
        damages} restore a promisee to the position he would have been in had 
        the promise not been made. % TODO example
        \item \textbf{Expectation interest}: the promisee is worse off than he 
        would have been if the promise had been performed. \textbf{Expectation 
        damages} restore the promisee to the position he would have been in 
        had the promise been performed. % TODO example
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Two types of \textbf{reliance damages}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Out-of-pocket costs}: costs incurred by promisee prior 
        to the breach. % TODO example
        \item \textbf{Opportunity costs}: the surplus the promisee would have 
        enjoyed if he had taken the opportunity that the promise led him to 
        forgo.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item To what extent should a relied-upon donative promise be enforced? 
    Should it be the extent of the reliance (the \textbf{reliance measure}) or 
    the full expectation of the promise (the \textbf{expectation measure})? See 
    casebook pp. 37--38 % TODO.
    \item The expectation measure can be useful where reliance damages are 
    difficult to establish but obviously significant.\footnote{Casebook p. 39.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{\emph{Goldstick v. ICM Realty}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The expectation measure is valuable because it's simple, and it 
    often covers opportunity costs that the reliance measure 
    misses.\footnote{Casebook p. 40.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Reliance Damages vs. Expectation Damages: \emph{D \& G Stout, 
Inc. v. Bacardi Imports, Inc.}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item D \& G, operating as General Liquors, faced the dilemma of whether 
    to sell out or scale down. Bacardi promised it would continue to deal with 
    General as its Northern Indiana distributor. Relying on this promise, 
    General turned down the selling price it had been offered from National 
    Wine \& Spirits. A week later, Bacardi withdrew its account, forcing 
    General to sell at a much lower price (\$550,000) than the original offer.
    \item Can General recover the difference in price from Bacardi? Trial 
    court: no. It dismissed General's complaint on the ground that Bacardi's 
    promise was not one on which it should reasonably expected General to 
    rely.\footnote{Casebook p. 42.}
    \item Indiana followed Restatement Second \S\ 90 on promissory estoppel.
    \item Appellate court:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item In at-will employment relationships in Indiana, employees cannot 
        sue for lost wages, but they \emph{can} sue for moving expenses 
        incurred on the basis of a promise.\footnote{Casebook p. 42.}
        \item This distinction is analogous to the distinction between 
        reliance damages (moving expenses) and expectation damages (lost 
        anticipated wages).
        \item Was General's loss the result of lost expectations of future 
        profit (expectation damages) or an opportunity foregone in reliance on 
        the promise (reliance damages)?
        \item In its negotiations, General relied on Bacardi's promise. The 
        devaluation of the company as a result of the broken promise was a 
        reliance injury, analogous to moving expenses.
        \item Reversed.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Expectation Damages: \emph{Walters v. Marathon Oil Co.}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Mr. and Mrs. Walters hoped to open a gas station. Relying on 
    promises from Marathon Oil, the Walters bought and renovated and abandoned 
    service station. Before signing the final agreement, Marathon put a 
    moratorium on new applications for dealerships. The Walters brought suit.
    \item The Walters argued that they should be able to recover lost 
    potential profits, totaling \$22,200 (370,000 gallons at six cents per 
    gallon).
    \item Marathon argued that the Walters should only be able to recover for 
    their reliance injury, i.e., the difference between their expenditures on 
    the site (purchase and renovations) and its present value.
    \item The trial court sided with the Walters and the appellate court 
    agreed, holding that the Walters had forgone the opportunity to make their 
    investment elsewhere.
    \item ``Since promissory estoppel is an equitable matter, the trial court 
    has broad power in its choice of a remedy~.~.~.~''\footnote{Casebook p. 
    45.}
