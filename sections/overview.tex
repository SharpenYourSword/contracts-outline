\subsection{Classical and Modern Contract Law}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{The nature of contract law reasoning}:\footnote{Casebook p. 83 
    ff.}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \emph{Substantive legal reasoning}: validity of a doctrine turns 
        on normative considerations (morals, policy, etc.).
        \item \emph{Formal legal reasoning}: law consists of doctrines that 
        are autonomous from policy, morality, and experience.
        \item \emph{Axiomatic legal reasoning}: ``fundamental doctrines can be 
        established on the ground that they are 
        self-evident.''\footnote{Casebook p. 83.}
        \item \emph{Deductive legal reasoning}: most doctrines follow from 
        syllogisms beginning with more fundamental doctrines.
        \item Classical contract law coupled axiomatic and deductive 
        reasoning.
        \item By contrast, modern contract law reasoning justifies doctrines 
        on the basis of morality, policy, and experience.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \emph{The deep structure of contract-law rules}: contract law can be 
    plotted along four primary axes:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Objectivity (directly observable state of the world) 
        $\leftrightarrow$ subjectivity (mental state).
        \item Standardization (depends on abstract variables) $\leftrightarrow$ 
        individualization (depends on situation-specific variables).
        \item Static (depends on what occurred at the moment the contract was 
        formed) $\leftrightarrow$ dynamic (depends on moving streams of events 
        before and after the contract).
        \item Binary (e.g., no damages or expectation damages) 
        $\leftrightarrow$ multifaceted (e.g., no damages, expectation damages, 
        reliance damages, restitution damages).
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Many other limits on contracts are surrogates for 
    unconscionability.\footnote{Casebook p. 86.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Consideration}

\subsubsection{Donative Promises}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Donative promises are not enforceable. \emph{Dougherty v. Salt}.
    \item But, gifts cannot be revoked once given.
    \item Acceptance alone is not consideration, but at some point, an act of 
    acceptance becomes consideration (the ``tramp example'').
    \item Courts generally do not consider the adequacy of consideration.
    \item Two conceptions:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \emph{Broad}: ``consideration'' refers collectively to the 
        things that make contracts legally enforceable---e.g., bargain or 
        reliance.\footnote{Casebook p. 8.}
        \item \emph{Narrow}: ``consideration'' is the same thing as 
        ``bargain.'' The Restatement Second adopts this approach, known as the 
        \textbf{bargain theory of consideration}.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Bargain promise}: the condition is the price---e.g., I'll 
    give you \$20 if you mow my lawn.
    \item \textbf{Conditional donative promise}: the condition is the means 
    to make the gift---e.g., I'll buy you a car if you pick one that costs 
    less than \$15,000.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Form}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Historically, formal elements (wax seals, etc.) indicated the 
    validity of an agreement. Today, the formal requirement is mostly gone.
    \item Ritual is not enough. To be valid, consideration must impose a legal 
    obligation. \emph{Schnell v. Nell}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Reliance and Promissory Estoppel}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Early courts did not recognize reliance as grounds for enforcing an 
    agreement. \emph{Kirksey v. Kirksey} (``Dear Sister Antillico~.~.~.~'').
    \item \textbf{Estoppel in pais} (or equitable estoppel): if A made a 
    statement and B foreseeably relied on that statement, A is estopped from 
    denying that statement's truth. Based on a \emph{statement of fact}.
    \item \textbf{Promissory estoppel}: a promise is binding if the promisee 
    reasonably relied on it. Based on a \emph{promise}. \emph{Feinberg v. 
    Pfeiffer}. Cf. \emph{Hayes v. Plantations Steel Co.}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Restatement \S\ 90: ``A promise which the promisor should 
        reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the 
        promisee or a third person and which does induce such action or 
        forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement 
        of the promise. The remedy granted for breach \textbf{may be limited 
        as justice requires}.''
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Reliance damages can compensate a party for injuries arising from 
    reliance. \emph{D \& G Stout, Inc. v. Bacardi Imports, Inc.}
    \item Courts are hesitant to award expectation damages for lost profits, 
    but they will if the venture was reasonably likely to be profitable. 
    \emph{Walters v. Marathon Oil Co.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{The Bargain Principle}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Consideration arises from a \textbf{bargained-for exchange}. Moral 
    obligations are not enough.
    \item Courts will not evaluate the adequacy of consideration as long as 
    the consideration created a legal obligation.
    \item Consideration can arise from an act or forbearance. \emph{Hamer v. 
    Sidway}, \emph{Davies v. Martel Laboratory Services, Inc.} See Restatement 
    \S\S\ 71, 72, 79.
    \item Bad (or great) deals are enforceable if there is consideration.
    \item Loan agreements are enforceable even if the amount to be repaid is 
    orders of magnitude larger than the amount loaned. \emph{Batsakis v. 
    Demotsis.}
    \item \textbf{Duress} will invalidate a contract. But, driving a hard 
    bargain is not wrongful. \emph{Chouinard v. Chouinard}.
    \item The rules against duress prevent a rescuer from unfairly profiting 
    from the rescue. However, the rules of \textbf{salvage} create an 
    incentive to rescue, striking a balance between the rescuer's effort and 
    the victim's need. \emph{Post v. Jones}.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \emph{The Desperate Traveler}: T is stranded in the desert. G 
        passes by and offers a ride for two-thirds of T's wealth or \$100,000, 
        whichever is more.
        \item Classical contract law would enforce the agreement because the 
        rescuer was not responsible for putting the promisor in a position of 
        distress. Salvage rules offer a solution by preventing the rescuer 
        from exploiting the one in distress while also creating an incentive 
        to rescue.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Price gouging is wrong.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Unconscionability}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Unconscionability arises when there is a lack of meaningful choice 
    and the terms of the agreement are unreasonable favorable to one party. 
    \emph{Williams v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co.}
    \item UCC \S\ 2-302: courts can rescind or reform unconscionable 
    contracts. Accord Restatement \S\ (invaliding agreements with \emph{gross} 
    disparities in consideration or bargaining power, but holding that 
    imbalances do not always indicate unconscionability).
    \item \textbf{Substantive unconscionability}: one-sidedness.
    \item \textbf{Procedural unconscionability}: fine-print surprises.  
    \emph{Maxwell v. Fidelity Fin. Servs., Inc.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Mutuality}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item ``As a contract defense, the mutuality doctrine has become a 
    faltering rampart to which a litigant retreats at his own 
    peril.''\footnote{Casebook p.  100.} \emph{Helle v. Landmark, Inc.}
    \item Restatement \S\ 79: if there is consideration, there are no 
    requirements of gain/loss, equivalence in value, or ``mutuality of 
    obligation.''
    \item \textbf{Illusory promises}: there is no consideration without 
    commitment. Today, courts will find a lack of mutuality only if one party 
    retains \textbf{complete} discretion to abandon the agreement. We also 
    require parties to perform in good faith.
    \item As long as there has been sufficient consideration, unequal terms do 
    not invalidate a contract. \emph{Lindner v. Mid-Continent Petroleum Corp.}
    \item \textbf{Satisfaction clauses} constitute consideration when courts 
    read them as requiring good faith. Otherwise, the satisfaction clause 
    would not involve a commitment, so the promise would be illusory. 
    \emph{Mattei v. Hopper}.
    \item Any bargained-for act or forbearance constitutes consideration. 
    \emph{Harris v. Time, Inc.}
    \item The intent of the parties outweighs ``primitive formalism.'' 
    \footnote{Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon}.
    \item Requirements contracts and output contracts:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \emph{Requirements contract}: a seller agrees to provide as much 
        of a good as the buyer requires.
        \item \emph{Output contract}: a buyer agrees to buy all of a seller's 
        output.
        \item Traditionally, ``courts often refused to enforce requirements 
        contracts where the buyer could choose to have no 
        requirements.''\footnote{Casebook p. 103.} But both parties shrunk 
        their realm of choice, so there was mutual consideration.
        \item UCC \S\ 2-306 requires good faith in requirements contracts.
        \item ``~.~.~.~a modern court would almost certainly hold that all 
        requirements and output contracts have consideration.''
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Legal Duty}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Performance of an existing duty is not consideration. \emph{Slattery 
    v. Wells Fargo Armored Serv. Corp.}, but see \emph{Denney v. Reppert}.
    \item Withholding performance does not create consideration for a 
    modification. \emph{Lingenfelder v. Wainwright Brewery Co.}
    \item The preexisting duty rule helps prevent extortion. \emph{Alaska 
    Packers' Association v. Domenico}. On the other hand, where a modification 
    involves consideration, the preexisting duty rule fails to stop extortion. 
    \emph{Austin Instrument, Inc. v. Loral} (where the court found valid 
    consideration, but nonetheless held for Loral on a theory of duress).
    \item The preexisting duty rule can also allow parties to renege on good 
    faith modifications. For example, A hires B to build a house for 
    \$100,000. The cost of materials rises during construction. A and B agree 
    to raise the contract price to \$150,000. When the job is done, A backs 
    out, claiming (1) that there was no consideration for the modification and 
    (2) that B was performing a preexisting duty.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Modification}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Today, courts generally do not require consideration for good faith 
    modifications. \emph{Schwartzreich v. Bauman-Basch, Inc.}, \emph{Angel v. 
    Murray}.
    \item \emph{Accord}: an agreement under which a new obligation replaces an 
    existing obligation.
    \item \emph{Executory accord}: an unperformed accord.
    \item \emph{Satisfaction}: performance of the accord.
    \item \textbf{Substituted contract}: the earlier agreement is immediately 
    discharged.
    \item Substituted contract vs. accord:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Courts are likely to find that an accord is a substituted 
        contract if the original duty ``was disputed, unliquidated, had not 
        matured, and involved a performance other than the payment of 
        money.''\footnote{Casebook pp. 136--37.} For instance, for 
        agricultural services, A agreed to pay B in cattle. They disagreed 
        over how many cattle were due. They agreed that A would pay three 
        sheep instead. Courts will likely treat the accord as a substituted 
        contract.
        \item Courts are likely to find that an accord is \emph{not} a 
        substituted contract if the original duty ``was undisputed, 
        liquidated, had matured, and involved the payment of 
        money.''\footnote{Casebook p. 137.} For instance, A agreed to pay 
        \$900 for B's services, and A does not dispute B's claim. They agree 
        that A will give two sheep instead of paying \$900.  Courts will 
        likely \emph{not} find that the accord is a substituted contract.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Restatement \S\ 89: a promise modifying an earlier contract is 
    binding when:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item It's fair;
        \item Provided by statute; or
        \item ``justice requires enforcement'' if a party relies on it.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Waiver}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Parties can waive contractual terms. \emph{Clark v. West}.
    \item Courts are split on whether waiver requires reliance. \emph{Nassau 
    Trust Co. v. Montrose Concrete Products Co.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Past Consideration}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Traditionally, there are \textbf{three areas} in which a promise to 
    discharge an unenforceable obligation is binding:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A promise to pay a debt barred by the statute of limitations.
        \item A promise by an adult to pay a debt incurred when the person was 
        underage.
        \item A promise to pay a debt that has been discharged in bankruptcy.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Moral obligations do not make promises enforceable. Past 
    consideration is required. \emph{Mills v. Wyman}, \emph{Harrington v. 
    Taylor}. But, equity sometimes compels courts to depart from the rule. 
    \emph{Webb v. McGowin}.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item ALI: past consideration is \emph{sometimes} binding. Some cases 
        are ``gratuitous transactions'' (with no consideration) and 
        ``quasi-contracts'' (with consideration, if justice 
        requires).\footnote{Casebook p. 160--61.}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item If A confers a benefit on B without B's prior request, the 
    subsequent relationship could fall into three categories:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item B is \textbf{legally obligated} to compensate A under the law of 
        \emph{unjust enrichment}---for instance, if A paid B money by mistake. 
        The Restatement (Second) adopts this approach, though courts 
        traditionally did not recognize it.
        \item B is \textbf{morally but not legally obligated} to compensate 
        A---for instance, if B has suffered a loss on rescuing A. \emph{Mills 
        v. Wyman.}
        \item B is \textbf{neither morally nor legally obligated} to 
        compensate A---e.g., ordinary gifts.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{The Limits of Contract}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Agreements do not always constitute a binding agreement---e.g., two 
    people agreeing to go to a party.
    \item Should courts enforce in vitro fertilization agreements? Until what 
    point can parties change their minds? \emph{In Re the Marriage of Witten.} 
    What about surrogacy agreements? \emph{R.R. v. M.H.}
    \item 42 U.S.C. \S\ 247(e): organs cannot be bought.
    \item Posner: any bureaucratic solution will be flawed, so let's allow the 
    sale of organs on the open market.
    \item Radin: ``In precluding sales but not gifts, market-inalienability 
    places some things outside the marketplace but not outside the realm of 
    social intercourse.''\footnote{Casebook p. 186.} Some things shouldn't be 
    commodified---children, organs, sexual services, and so on.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Remedies}

\subsubsection{Overview}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Expectation}: puts promisee in the position he would have 
    been in if the contract had been \emph{performed}. You get what you 
    bargained for.
    \item \textbf{Reliance}: puts promisee in the position he would have been 
    in 
    if the contract had \emph{not been made}.
    \item \textbf{Restitution}: restores to the promisee any benefit he 
    conferred to the promisor.
    \item Expectation damages are the difference between promised performance 
    and actual performance---for instance, between a perfect hand and a hairy 
    hand. \emph{Hawkins v. McGee}.
    \item Damages compensate a party for actual losses. No punitive damages. 
    \emph{U.S. Naval Inst. v.  Charter Commc'ns, Inc.}
    \item Classical contract law did not permit a seller to profit from 
    breach. \emph{Coppola Enters., Inc. v. Alfone}. Some courts viewed it as a 
    breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. \emph{Greer Props., 
    Inc. v. LaSalle Nat'l Bank}.
    \item Posner argues for efficient breach. Eisenberg responds that 
    efficient breach is ultimately not so efficient.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Expectation Damages}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Breach of contract to perform services}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If a contractor leaves a job unfinished, the client can recover 
        \textbf{cost of completion} damages. \emph{Louise Caroline Nursing 
        Home, Inc. v. Dix Construction Co.}
        \item Where cost of performance exceeds \textbf{diminution in value}, 
        courts are likely to award damages only for diminution in value.  
        \emph{Peevyhouse v. Garland Coal \& Mining Co.} Courts are wary of 
        awarding cost of completion damages when the cost is \textbf{grossly 
        disproportionate} to the benefits (\emph{H.P. Droher \& Sons v. 
        Toushin}) or when it would cause waste (\emph{Eastern Steamship Lines, 
        Inc. v.  United States}).
        \item Courts are more likely to award cost of completion damages when 
        the defects are aesthetically important (e.g., a fancy swimming 
        pool---\emph{City School Dist. of the City of Elmira v.  McLane Const.  
        Co.}) or the project involves someone's home (\emph{Fox v. Webb}).  
        \item Calculating damages for partially performed services:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Contract price - value of performance completed - amount 
            paid by owner prior to breach. Restatement Second \S\ 346.
            \item Example: A contracts to build a house for B for \$100,000. B 
            breaches halfway through. A would have to spend \$60,000 to 
            finish.  A's damages are the contract price (\$100,000) - cost of 
            completion that the contractor saved (\$60,000) = \$40,000. A can 
            recover \$40,000 minus any payments already made.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Breach of a contract for the sale of goods}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The UCC governs sale of goods.
        \item \textbf{Seller's breach}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Two remedies: \textbf{specific relief} and \textbf{damages}.
            \item For defective goods, courts might award damages for the 
            \textbf{cost of repair} in excess of the purchase price.  UCC \S\ 
            2-714(2) sets the measure of direct damages for breach of warranty 
            as the difference between the value of the goods as warranted and 
            the value of the goods as accepted, often approximated as the cost 
            of repair.
            \item When the seller fails to deliver goods sold, the buyer has 
            two options:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \emph{Cover}: the buyer purchases a replacement. Damages 
                are the difference between the replacement price and the 
                contract price. UCC \S\ 7-212 and \emph{KGM Harvesting Co. v. 
                Fresh Network.}
                \item \emph{Hypothetical cover} or \textbf{market price} 
                damages: the buyer recovers the difference between the market 
                price at the time of the breach and the contract price. UCC 
                \S\ 7-213.
            \end{itemize}
            \item When a buyer covers, can he still recover market price 
            damages under UCC \S\ 7-213, rather than the actual cost of cover 
            under \S\ 2-712?
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Example: a buyer agrees to buy a steamroller for 
                \$1,000. The market price for steamrollers is \$1,300 at the 
                time of the breach. The buyer waits six months to cover, when 
                the market price has dropped to \$500. Under \S\ 2-712, he can 
                recover nothing, but under 2-713, he can recover \$300.
                \item The UCC has been updated to force covering buyers to use 
                \S\ 7-212, but most states have not yet adopted the change.
