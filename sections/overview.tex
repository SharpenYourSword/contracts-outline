\section{Overview}

\subsection{Classical and Modern Contract Law}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{The nature of contract law reasoning}:\footnote{Casebook p. 83 
    ff.}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \emph{Substantive legal reasoning}: validity of a doctrine turns 
        on normative considerations (morals, policy, etc.).
        \item \emph{Formal legal reasoning}: law consists of doctrines that 
        are autonomous from policy, morality, and experience.
        \item \emph{Axiomatic legal reasoning}: ``fundamental doctrines can be 
        established on the ground that they are 
        self-evident.''\footnote{Casebook p. 83.}
        \item \emph{Deductive legal reasoning}: most doctrines follow from 
        syllogisms beginning with more fundamental doctrines.
        \item Classical contract law coupled axiomatic and deductive 
        reasoning.
        \item By contrast, modern contract law reasoning justifies doctrines 
        on the basis of morality, policy, and experience.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \emph{The deep structure of contract-law rules}: contract law can be 
    plotted along four primary axes:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Objectivity (directly observable state of the world) 
        $\leftrightarrow$ subjectivity (mental state).
        \item Standardization (depends on abstract variables) $\leftrightarrow$ 
        individualization (depends on situation-specific variables).
        \item Static (depends on what occurred at the moment the contract was 
        formed) $\leftrightarrow$ dynamic (depends on moving streams of events 
        before and after the contract).
        \item Binary (e.g., no damages or expectation damages) 
        $\leftrightarrow$ multifaceted (e.g., no damages, expectation damages, 
        reliance damages, restitution damages).
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Many other limits on contracts are surrogates for 
    unconscionability.\footnote{Casebook p. 86.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Consideration}

\subsubsection{Donative Promises}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Donative promises are not enforceable. \emph{Dougherty v. Salt}.
    \item But, gifts cannot be revoked once given.
    \item Acceptance alone is not consideration, but at some point, an act of 
    acceptance involves so much effort that it becomes consideration (the 
    ``tramp example'').
    \item Courts generally do not consider the adequacy of consideration.
    \item Two conceptions:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \emph{Broad}: ``consideration'' refers collectively to the 
        things that make contracts legally enforceable---e.g., bargain or 
        reliance.\footnote{Casebook p. 8.}
        \item \emph{Narrow}: ``consideration'' is the same thing as 
        ``bargain.'' The Restatement Second adopts this approach, known as the 
        \textbf{bargain theory of consideration}.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Bargain promise}: the condition is the price---e.g., I'll 
    give you \$20 if you mow my lawn.
    \item \textbf{Conditional donative promise}: the condition is the means 
    to make the gift---e.g., I'll buy you a car if you pick one that costs 
    less than \$15,000.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Form}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Historically, formal elements (wax seals, etc.) indicated the 
    validity of an agreement. Today, the formal requirement is mostly gone.
    \item Ritual is not enough. To be valid, consideration must impose a legal 
    obligation. \emph{Schnell v. Nell}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Reliance and Promissory Estoppel}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Early courts did not recognize reliance as grounds for enforcing an 
    agreement. \emph{Kirksey v. Kirksey} (``Dear Sister Antillico~.~.~.~'').
    \item \textbf{Estoppel in pais} (or equitable estoppel): if A made a 
    statement and B foreseeably relied on that statement, A is estopped from 
    denying that statement's truth. Based on a \emph{statement of fact}.
    \item \textbf{Promissory estoppel}: a promise is binding if the promisee 
    reasonably relied on it. Based on a \emph{promise}. \emph{Feinberg v. 
    Pfeiffer}. Cf. \emph{Hayes v. Plantations Steel Co.}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Restatement \S\ 90: ``A promise which the promisor should 
        reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the 
        promisee or a third person and which does induce such action or 
        forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement 
        of the promise. The remedy granted for breach \textbf{may be limited 
        as justice requires}.''
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Reliance damages can compensate a party for injuries arising from 
    reliance. \emph{D \& G Stout, Inc. v. Bacardi Imports, Inc.}
    \item Courts are hesitant to award expectation damages for lost profits, 
    but they will if the venture was reasonably likely to be profitable. 
    \emph{Walters v. Marathon Oil Co.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{The Bargain Principle}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Consideration arises from a \textbf{bargained-for exchange}. Moral 
    obligations are not enough.
    \item Courts will not evaluate the adequacy of consideration as long as 
    the consideration created a legal obligation.
    \item Consideration can arise from an act or forbearance. \emph{Hamer v. 
    Sidway}, \emph{Davies v. Martel Laboratory Services, Inc.} See Restatement 
    \S\S\ 71, 72, 79.
    \item Bad (or great) deals are enforceable if there is consideration.
    \item Loan agreements are enforceable even if the amount to be repaid is 
    orders of magnitude larger than the amount loaned. \emph{Batsakis v. 
    Demotsis.}
    \item \textbf{Duress} will invalidate a contract. But, driving a hard 
    bargain is not wrongful. \emph{Chouinard v. Chouinard}.
    \item The rules against duress prevent a rescuer from unfairly profiting 
    from the rescue. However, the rules of \textbf{salvage} create an 
    incentive to rescue, striking a balance between the rescuer's effort and 
    the victim's need. \emph{Post v. Jones}.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \emph{The Desperate Traveler}: T is stranded in the desert. G 
        passes by and offers a ride for two-thirds of T's wealth or \$100,000, 
        whichever is more.
        \item Classical contract law would enforce the agreement because the 
        rescuer was not responsible for putting the promisor in a position of 
        distress. Salvage rules offer a solution by preventing the rescuer 
        from exploiting the one in distress while also creating an incentive 
        to rescue.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Price gouging is wrong.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Unconscionability}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Unconscionability arises when there is a lack of meaningful choice 
    and the terms of the agreement are unreasonable favorable to one party. 
    \emph{Williams v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co.}
    \item UCC \S\ 2-302: courts can rescind or reform unconscionable 
    contracts. Accord Restatement \S\ (invaliding agreements with \emph{gross} 
    disparities in consideration or bargaining power, but holding that 
    imbalances do not always indicate unconscionability).
    \item There's no easy way to explain unconscionability. The UCC and the 
    Restatement struggle to define it. As soon as we define it, people will 
    draft around it. But we know it when we see it.
    \item \textbf{Substantive unconscionability}: one-sidedness.
    \item \textbf{Procedural unconscionability}: fine-print surprises.  
    \emph{Maxwell v. Fidelity Fin. Servs., Inc.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Mutuality}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Under classical contract law, mutual benefit and detriment make a 
    contract binding.
    \item ``As a contract defense, the mutuality doctrine has become a 
    faltering rampart to which a litigant retreats at his own 
    peril.''\footnote{Casebook p.  100.} \emph{Helle v. Landmark, Inc.}
    \item Restatement \S\ 79: if there is consideration, there are no 
    requirements of gain/loss, equivalence in value, or ``mutuality of 
    obligation.''
    \item \textbf{Illusory promises}: there is no consideration without 
    commitment. Today, courts will find a lack of mutuality only if one party 
    retains \textbf{complete} discretion to abandon the agreement. We also 
    require parties to perform in good faith.
    \item As long as there has been sufficient consideration, unequal terms do 
    not invalidate a contract. \emph{Lindner v. Mid-Continent Petroleum Corp.}
    \item \textbf{Satisfaction clauses} constitute consideration when courts 
    read them as requiring good faith. Otherwise, the satisfaction clause 
    would not involve a commitment, so the promise would be illusory. 
    \emph{Mattei v. Hopper}.
    \item Any bargained-for act or forbearance constitutes consideration. 
    \emph{Harris v. Time, Inc.}
    \item The intent of the parties outweighs \textbf{``primitive 
    formalism.''} \footnote{Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon}.
    \item Requirements contracts and output contracts:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \emph{Requirements contract}: a seller agrees to provide as much 
        of a good as the buyer requires.
        \item \emph{Output contract}: a buyer agrees to buy all of a seller's 
        output.
        \item Traditionally, ``courts often refused to enforce requirements 
        contracts where the buyer could choose to have no 
        requirements.''\footnote{Casebook p. 103.} But both parties shrunk 
        their realm of choice, so there was mutual consideration.
        \item UCC \S\ 2-306 requires good faith in requirements contracts.
        \item ``~.~.~.~a modern court would almost certainly hold that all 
        requirements and output contracts have consideration.''
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Legal Duty}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Performance of an existing duty is not consideration. \emph{Slattery 
    v. Wells Fargo Armored Serv. Corp.}, but see \emph{Denney v. Reppert}.
    \item Withholding performance does not create consideration for a 
    modification. \emph{Lingenfelder v. Wainwright Brewery Co.}
    \item The preexisting duty rule helps prevent extortion. \emph{Alaska 
    Packers' Association v. Domenico}. On the other hand, where a modification 
    involves consideration, the preexisting duty rule fails to stop extortion. 
    \emph{Austin Instrument, Inc. v. Loral} (where the court found valid 
    consideration, but nonetheless held for Loral on a theory of duress).
    \item The preexisting duty rule can also allow parties to renege on good 
    faith modifications. For example, A hires B to build a house for 
    \$100,000. The cost of materials rises during construction. A and B agree 
    to raise the contract price to \$150,000. When the job is done, A backs 
    out, claiming (1) that there was no consideration for the modification and 
    (2) that B was performing a preexisting duty.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Modification}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Today, courts generally do not require consideration for good faith 
    modifications. \emph{Schwartzreich v. Bauman-Basch, Inc.}, \emph{Angel v. 
    Murray}.
    \item \emph{Accord}: an agreement under which a new obligation replaces an 
    existing obligation.
    \item \emph{Executory accord}: an unperformed accord.
    \item \emph{Satisfaction}: performance of the accord.
    \item \textbf{Substituted contract}: the earlier agreement is immediately 
    discharged.
    \item Substituted contract vs. accord:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Courts are likely to find that an accord is a substituted 
        contract if the original duty ``was disputed, unliquidated, had not 
        matured, and involved a performance other than the payment of 
        money.''\footnote{Casebook pp. 136--37.} For instance, for 
        agricultural services, A agreed to pay B in cattle. They disagreed 
        over how many cattle were due. They agreed that A would pay three 
        sheep instead. Courts will likely treat the accord as a substituted 
        contract.
        \item Courts are likely to find that an accord is \emph{not} a 
        substituted contract if the original duty ``was undisputed, 
        liquidated, had matured, and involved the payment of 
        money.''\footnote{Casebook p. 137.} For instance, A agreed to pay 
        \$900 for B's services, and A does not dispute B's claim. They agree 
        that A will give two sheep instead of paying \$900.  Courts will 
        likely \emph{not} find that the accord is a substituted contract.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Restatement \S\ 89: a promise modifying an earlier contract is 
    binding when:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item It's fair;
        \item Provided by statute; or
        \item ``justice requires enforcement'' if a party relies on it.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Waiver}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Parties can waive contractual terms. \emph{Clark v. West}.
    \item Courts are split on whether waiver requires reliance. \emph{Nassau 
    Trust Co. v. Montrose Concrete Products Co.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Past Consideration}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Traditionally, there are \textbf{three areas} in which a promise to 
    discharge an unenforceable obligation is binding:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A promise to pay a debt barred by the statute of limitations.
        \item A promise by an adult to pay a debt incurred when the person was 
        underage.
        \item A promise to pay a debt that has been discharged in bankruptcy.
    \end{enumerate}
    % TODO define past consideration
    \item Moral obligations do not make promises enforceable. Past 
    consideration is required. \emph{Mills v. Wyman}, \emph{Harrington v. 
    Taylor}. But, equity sometimes compels courts to depart from the rule. 
    \emph{Webb v. McGowin}.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item ALI: past consideration is \emph{sometimes} binding. Some cases 
        are ``gratuitous transactions'' (with no consideration) and 
        ``quasi-contracts'' (with consideration, if justice 
        requires).\footnote{Casebook p. 160--61.}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item If A confers a benefit on B without B's prior request, the 
    subsequent relationship could fall into three categories:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item B is \textbf{legally obligated} to compensate A under the law of 
        \emph{unjust enrichment}---for instance, if A paid B money by mistake. 
        The Restatement (Second) adopts this approach, though courts 
        traditionally did not recognize it.
        \item B is \textbf{morally but not legally obligated} to compensate 
        A---for instance, if B has suffered a loss on rescuing A. \emph{Mills 
        v. Wyman.}
        \item B is \textbf{neither morally nor legally obligated} to 
        compensate A---e.g., ordinary gifts.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{The Limits of Contract}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Agreements do not always constitute a binding agreement---e.g., two 
    people agreeing to go to a party.
    \item Should courts enforce in vitro fertilization agreements? Until what 
    point can parties change their minds? \emph{In Re the Marriage of Witten.} 
    What about surrogacy agreements? \emph{R.R. v. M.H.}
    \item 42 U.S.C. \S\ 247(e): organs cannot be bought.
    \item Posner: any bureaucratic solution will be flawed, so let's allow the 
    sale of organs on the open market.
    \item Radin: ``In precluding sales but not gifts, market-inalienability 
    places some things outside the marketplace but not outside the realm of 
    social intercourse.''\footnote{Casebook p. 186.} Some things shouldn't be 
    commodified---children, organs, sexual services, and so on.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Remedies}

\subsubsection{Overview}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Expectation}: puts promisee in the position he would have 
    been in if the contract had been \emph{performed}. You get what you 
    bargained for.
    \item \textbf{Reliance}: puts promisee in the position he would have been 
    in 
    if the contract had \emph{not been made}.
    \item \textbf{Restitution}: restores to the promisee any benefit he 
    conferred to the promisor.
    \item Expectation damages are the difference between promised performance 
    and actual performance---for instance, between a perfect hand and a hairy, 
    scarred hand. \emph{Hawkins v. McGee}.
    \item Damages compensate a party for actual losses. No punitive damages. 
    \emph{U.S. Naval Inst. v.  Charter Commc'ns, Inc.}
    \item Classical contract law did not permit a seller to profit from 
    breach. \emph{Coppola Enters., Inc. v. Alfone}. Some courts viewed it as a 
    breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. \emph{Greer Props., 
    Inc. v. LaSalle Nat'l Bank}.
    \item Posner argues for efficient breach. Eisenberg responds that 
    efficient breach is ultimately not so efficient.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Expectation Damages}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Breach of contract to perform services}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If a contractor leaves a job unfinished, the client can recover 
        \textbf{cost of completion} standards. \emph{Louise Caroline Nursing 
        Home, Inc. v. Dix Construction Co.}
        \item Where cost of performance exceeds \textbf{diminution in value}, 
        courts are likely to award damages only for diminution in value.  
        \emph{Peevyhouse v. Garland Coal \& Mining Co.} Courts are wary of 
        awarding cost of completion damages when the cost is \textbf{grossly 
        disproportionate} to the benefits (\emph{H.P. Droher \& Sons v. 
        Toushin}) or when it would cause waste (\emph{Eastern Steamship Lines, 
        Inc. v.  United States}).
        \item Courts are more likely to award cost of completion damages when 
        the defects are aesthetically important (e.g., a fancy swimming 
        pool---\emph{City School Dist. of the City of Elmira v.  McLane Const.  
        Co.}) or the project involves someone's home (\emph{Fox v. Webb}).  
        \item Calculating damages for partially performed services:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Contract price - value of performance completed - amount 
            paid by owner prior to breach. Restatement Second \S\ 346.
            \item Example: A contracts to build a house for B for \$100,000. B 
            breaches halfway through. A would have to spend \$60,000 to 
            finish.  A's damages are the contract price (\$100,000) - cost of 
            completion that the contractor saved (\$60,000) = \$40,000. A can 
            recover \$40,000 minus any payments already made.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Breach of a contract for the sale of goods}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The UCC governs sale of goods.
        \item \textbf{Seller's breach}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Two remedies: \textbf{specific relief} and \textbf{damages}.
            \item For defective goods, courts might award damages for the 
            \textbf{cost of repair} in excess of the purchase price.  UCC \S\ 
            2-714(2) sets the measure of direct damages for breach of warranty 
            as the difference between the value of the goods as warranted and 
            the value of the goods as accepted, often approximated as the cost 
            of repair.
            \item When the seller fails to deliver goods sold, the buyer has 
            two options:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \emph{Cover}: the buyer purchases a replacement. Damages 
                are the difference between the replacement price and the 
                contract price. UCC \S\ 7-212 and \emph{KGM Harvesting Co. v. 
                Fresh Network.}
                \item \emph{Hypothetical cover} or \textbf{market price} 
                damages: the buyer recovers the difference between the market 
                price at the time of the breach and the contract price. UCC 
                \S\ 7-213.
            \end{itemize}
            \item When covering, the UCC 2-713 allows goods of a different 
            level of quality. \footnote{Egerer v. CSR West, LLC.}
            \item When a buyer covers, can he still recover market price 
            damages under UCC \S\ 7-213, rather than the actual cost of cover 
            under \S\ 2-712?
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Example: a buyer agrees to buy a steamroller for 
                \$1,000. The market price for steamrollers is \$1,300 at the 
                time of the breach. The buyer waits six months to cover, when 
                the market price has dropped to \$500. Under \S\ 2-712, he can 
                recover nothing, but under 2-713, he can recover \$300.
                \item The UCC has been updated to force covering buyers to use 
                \S\ 7-212, but most states have not yet adopted the change.
            \end{itemize}
            \item If replacing the goods is not possible, courts will award 
            the \textbf{cost of repair}, even if it exceeds the purchase 
            price.  \emph{Continental Sand \& Gravel, Inc. v. K \& K Sand \& 
            Gravel, Inc.}
            \item Buyers can recover reasonable \textbf{incidental damages} 
            related to the goods in question. \emph{Delchi Carrier SpA v. 
            Rotorex Corp.}
        \end{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Buyer's breach}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item When buyer breaches and the seller justifiably withholds 
            goods, UCC \S\ 2-718 allows the buyer to win restitution by the 
            amount his payments exceed (1) specified liquidated damages or (2) 
            20\% of the total performance, or \$500, whichever is smaller.
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item However, the buyer's restitution damages can be offset 
                if the seller shows damages under another UCC 
                provision---e.g., \textbf{lost profits} under UCC \S\ 2-708. 
                \emph{Neri v. Retail Marine Corp.}
            \end{enumerate}
            % TODO UCC 2-708, esp 708(2)
            \item A \textbf{lost volume seller} has ``the capacity to supply 
            the breached units in addition to what it actually sold.'' Lost 
            volume sellers should be able to recover lost profits from the 
            loss of a single sale. An exception occurs when the volume would 
            be so high that sales would no longer be profitable (e.g., 
            McDonalds can sell a billion hamburgers, but it could not sell 1.5 
            billion without significant infrastructure expansions---so, the 
            extra 0.5 billion sales would not have been profitable, so 
            McDonalds should not be able to recover for lost sales, even 
            though it is a lost volume seller.) \emph{R.E. Davis Chemical Corp. 
            v. Diasonics, Inc.}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Second-hand car dealers are not lost volume sellers 
                because each used car is unique. If a buyer of a used car 
                breaches, the seller cannot recover if it sells the same car 
                to another buyer for the same price. \emph{Lazenby Garages 
                Ltd. v. Wright}.
            \end{enumerate}
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Mitigation and contracts for employment}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Both parties have a \textbf{duty to mitigate} damages after 
        breach. \emph{Rockingham County v. Luten Bridge Co.}
        \item The duty to mitigate applies even if the goods are different 
        than what the contract specified. \emph{Maden v. Murray \& Sons, Inc.}
        \item The defaulting party cannot dictate how the other party must 
        mitigate. As long as the mitigating party acted \textbf{reasonably}, 
        he has fulfilled his duty to mitigate. \emph{In Re Kellet Aircraft 
        Corporation}. Similarly, the mitigating party need not make 
        unreasonable effort to mitigate. \footnote{Bank One, Texas N.A. v. 
        Taylor}.
        \item Where the defendant had an equal opportunity to mitigate loss, 
        he cannot reasonably contend that the plaintiff failed to mitigate. 
        \emph{S.J. Groves \& Sons Co. v. Warner Co.}
        \item % TODO UCC 2-704, 2-715
        \item Employees have a duty to mitigate, but only by seeking 
        \textbf{similar employment}. \emph{Shirley MacLaine Parker v.  
        Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp.}, \emph{Punkar v. King Plastic 
        Corp.} Employers must compensate wrongfully discharged employees for 
        reasonable expenses incurred in mitigation. \emph{Punkar v. King 
        Plastic Corp.}
        \item Plaintiffs can recover \textbf{reputation damages} if they can 
        prove specific losses. \emph{Redgrave v. Boston Symphony Orchestra, 
        Inc.}\footnote{Squibbed on casebook pp. 276--77.}
        \item English courts have allowed recovery for loss of opportunity to 
        appear before the public, but American courts have not, absent 
        evidence of specific losses.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Foreseeability}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \emph{Hadley v. Baxendale}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \emph{First rule}: the party in breach is liable for 
            reasonably foreseeable damages.
            \item \emph{Second rule}: if the party in breach is aware of 
            special circumstances, he is liable for extra loss those 
            circumstances create. But he is not liable for the extra loss if 
            he was not aware of the special circumstances.
            \item Courts apply \emph{Hadley} to determine whether a 
            \textbf{type} or \emph{amount} of damages is reasonably 
            foreseeable.
            \item Courts sometimes deviate from the \emph{Hadley} 
            foreseeability rule.\footnote{Casebook pp. 288--89.}
        \end{enumerate}
        \item A commercial machine has only commercial uses. It's reasonably 
        foreseeable that failing to deliver the machine will hinder commerce. 
        \emph{Victoria Laundry (Windsor) Ltd. v. Newman Indus. Ltd.}
        \item Fluctuations in market price are foreseeable. So, for instance, 
        shippers are liable if their delay causes goods to be sold at a lower 
        market price. \emph{Koufos v. C. Czarnikow, Ltd. (The Heron II)}
        \item If shipments of commercial machinery are delayed, the shipper 
        can be liable for rental charges in the interim, as long as the 
        equipment has an obvious commercial use. \emph{Hector Martinez \& Co. 
        v. Southern Pacific Transp. Co.}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Certainty}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item To recover damages for lost profits, the plaintiff must show 
        with certainty that the breach caused the alleged amount of loss. 
        \emph{Kenford Co. v. Erie County}, \emph{Ashland Management Inc. v. 
        Janien}.
        \item The certainty rule has less punch today because we're better at 
        calculating damages.
        \item The \textbf{new business rule}: courts are wary of awarding 
        speculative damages to new ventures.
        \item Consistency in earlier performance can strengthen the case for 
        speculative damages.
        \item Statistical evidence of the performance of similar ventures can 
        help establish damages. \emph{Contemporary Mission, Inc. v. Famous 
        Music Corp.}
        \item \textbf{All or nothing rule}: one premise of \emph{Kenford} is 
        that there is some level of certainty above which the plaintiff can 
        fully recover, and below which the plaintiff can recover nothing. This 
        is wrong---the plaintiff should be compensated for the value of the 
        \emph{chance} to earn a profit, even if it is not certain that a 
        profit would result.
        \item Fuller and Eisenberg propose a formula for calculating damages 
        based on probability based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model: damages 
        should be awarded in proportion their likelihood.  So if a venture has 
        as 10\% chance of \$20 million and a 90\% chance of \$10 million, the 
        award should be (0.10 x \$20 million) + (0.90 x \$10 million), or \$11 
        million.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Liquidated damages}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Liquidated damages clauses must reasonably approximate 
        anticipated or actual damages. \emph{Wasserman's Inc. v. Middletown}.
        \item Liquidates damages were traditionally frowned upon because they 
        could be punitive. But today, there's a resurgence, especially among 
        law and economics scholars, because the parties are in the best 
        position to calculate damages.
        \item Underliquidated damages---an amount less than actual estimated 
        damages---are usually enforced.
        \item Other techniques include limiting liability for consequential 
        damages or provisions that sellers' responsibilities are limited to 
        replacing or repairing defective goods.
        \item % TODO ucc on liquidated damages?
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Specific Performance}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item At common law, only equity courts could award specific performance.
    \item Courts will rarely award specific performance when money damages 
    will suffice. \emph{London Bucket Co. v. Stewart}. For efficiency reasons, 
    other courts are willing to award injunctions when damages would be 
    sufficient---e.g., to encourage negotiation. \emph{Walgreen Co. v. Sara 
    Creek Property Co.}
    \item Contracts cannot provide for injunctions because the court has sole 
    discretion in determining whether to issue an injunction. \emph{Stokes v. 
    Moore}
    \item Specific performance is appropriate when the \textbf{value of property is 
    uncertain}, but not because the property is unique---because every piece 
    of property is unique.  \emph{Van Wagner Advertising Corp. v. S \& M 
    Enterprises}.
    \item % TODO UCC 2-709, 2-716
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Reliance Damages}

\begin{enumerate}
    % TODO: add cases from consideration
    \item When there are no measurable lost profits, reliance damages may be 
    the only way to avoid injustice. \emph{Security Stove \& Mfg. Co. v. 
    American Rys. Express Co.} Lost potential profits cannot be calculated 
    with certainty, but expenditures can---so when lost profits are uncertain, 
    reliance damages can be appropriate. \emph{Beefy Trail, Inc. v. Beefy King 
    Int'l, Inc.}
    \item Expenses made before the contract can be recovered under reliance 
    damages if the breach caused them to be \textbf{wasted}. \emph{Anglia 
    Television Co. v. Reed}.
    \item Reliance damages should be offset if the seller can prove that 
    the buyer's venture would not have been profitable enough to cover its 
    expenses. \emph{L. Albert \& Son v. Armstrong Rubber Co.}
    \item A promisee can recover reliance damages from a promisor after the 
    promise was made, but not for similar activity prior to the promise. For 
    instance, as part of a contract with B, C ships goods to A. After several 
    shipments, B defaults. A promises that it will pay C for the goods it 
    ships to A. C can recover reliance damages for the cost of shipments after 
    A's promise, but not for prior shipments. \emph{Westside Galvanizing 
    Servs., Inc. v. Georgia-Pacific Corp.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Restitution Damages}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The non-breaching party will sometimes be satisfied with rescission 
    of the contract and restitution of any value conferred on the breaching 
    party. The purpose of restitution is to \textbf{prevent unjust 
    enrichment}. \emph{Osteen v. Johnson}.
    \item Restitution damages are based on \textbf{benefit incurred}. while 
    reliance damages are based on \textbf{cost incurred}.
    \item \textbf{Unjust enrichment}: measured by the benefit the plaintiff 
    conferred on the defendant.
    \item \textbf{\emph{Quantum meruit}}: measured by the value of the 
    plaintiff's services. The plaintiff can recover even if performance of the 
    contract would have resulted in a loss. \emph{United States v. Algernon 
    Blair, Inc.}
    \item Restitution damages are not available when parties have performed 
    all of the contract except payment. \emph{Oliver v. Campbell}.
    \item The promisee in an unprofitable contract can recover the value of 
    benefit incurred, even if it exceeds the contract price. \emph{United 
    States v. Algernon Blair, Inc.} For costs incurred (i.e., reliance 
    damages), the damages award should not exceed the contract price.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Restatement \S\ 349: reliance damages are an alternative 
        to expectation damages---but they should only apply when expectation 
        damages are too uncertain or should be limited for other reasons.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item At common law, the breaching party could not recover. However, the 
    modern trend is to allow the breaching party to recover for benefit 
    conferred (minus actual injuries). To allow the non-breaching party to 
    retain the benefit conferred beyond actual injury would be unjust 
    enrichment. \emph{Kutzin v. Pirnie}, Restatement \S\ 374(1).
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item ``~.~.~.~the breaching party is entitled to the reasonable value 
        of its services less any damages caused by the 
        breach.''\footnote{Casebook p. 362.}
        \item ``~.~.~.~a party injured by breach of contract is entitled to 
        retain nothing in excess of that sum which compensates him for the 
        loss of his bargain.''\footnote{Casebook p. 364.} \emph{Vines v. 
        Orchard Hills, Inc.}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Assent}

\subsubsection{Interpretation}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Contracts generally require a \textbf{``meeting of the 
    minds.''}\footnote{Casebook p. 368.}
    \item What happens in cases of misinterpretation? There's a tension 
    between subjective and objective intent.
    \item Courts will hold parties to a party's ``outward expression as 
    expressing his intent, rather than his ``secret and unexpressed 
    intention.''\footnote{Casebook p. 373.} \emph{Lucy v. Zehmer}.
    \item No contract is made when ``the whole transaction between the parties 
    was a frolic and a banter.''\footnote{Casebook p. 374.} \emph{Keller v. 
    Holderman}.
    \item In light of \textbf{``latent ambiguities''} (e.g., multiple ships 
    named ``Peerless''), courts will accept additional evidence of the 
    parties' intent. If there was no meeting of the minds, there was no 
    contract. \emph{Raffles v. Wichelhaus}, \emph{Oswald v. Allen}.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item ``If neither party can be assigned the greater blame for the 
        misunderstanding, there is no nonarbitrary basis for deciding which 
        party's understanding to enforce, so the parties are allowed to 
        abandon the contract without liability.''\footnote{Casebook p. 381.} 
        \emph{Colfax Envelope Corp. v. Local No. 458-3M}.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Courts consider many sources in determining the meaning of a word, 
    including dictionaries, trade usage, regulatory usage, and plain meaning. 
    \emph{Frigaliment Importing Co. v. B.N.S. Intern. Sales Co.}
    \item Parties can communicate in codes unique to them as long as both 
    parties agree on the meaning. \emph{Falck v. Williams}.
    \item Contracts generally require a meeting of the minds, but intent is 
    irrelevant if the other party \textbf{could not reasonably know} the 
    other's intent (and if the objective meaning was clear). \emph{Embry v. 
    Hargadine, McKittrick Dry Goods Co.}
    % TODO restatement 20, 201 -- and in main section
    % TODO berring, `MCC-Marble Ceramic Center'
    \item If one party knows the other's subjective intent, he can't fool him 
    by making an agreement that intentionally contradicts that intent (e.g., 
    if a buyer thinks he's buying unencumbered property, the seller can't 
    conceal the current tenant's purchase option). \emph{Mayol v. Weiner 
    Companies, Ltd.}
    \item \textbf{Classical vs. modern interpretation}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Classical contract law largely \textbf{disregarded the parties' 
        intent}.
        \item There are \textbf{four principles of interpretation} in modern 
        contract law:\footnote{Casebook p. 394--95.}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The more reasonable meaning prevails If both parties attach 
            different subjective meanings to an expression  and they are not 
            equally reasonable.
            \item But if the two meanings are equally reasonable, neither 
            prevails.
            \item If the parties attach the same meaning, that meaning 
            prevails even if it is unreasonable.
            \item If A and B attach different meanings, and A knows B's 
            meaning but B doesn't know A's, B's meaning prevails even if it is 
            less reasonable.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item ``~.~.~.~where the parties have not clearly expressed the 
    \textbf{duration of a contract}, the courts will imply that they intended 
    performance to continue for a reasonable time.''\footnote{Casebook p. 
    401.}
    % TODO restatement 204 and in main sec
    \item Some courts hold that they should take \textbf{``material 
    circumstances''} into account to honor the parties' 
    intent. \emph{Spaulding v. Morse}. Others disagree. \emph{Lawson v. Martin 
    Timber Co.}
    \item Some amount of interpretation is always necessary---e.g., ``fetch 
    some soupmeat.''\footnote{Casebook p. 405.}
    \item \textbf{Trade usage} applies to terms of agreements between parties 
    involved in a particular trade, e.g., textiles. \emph{Foxco Industries, 
    Ltd. v. Fabric World, Inc.}
    \begin{enumerate}
        % TODO UCC 2-202
        % TODO restatement 221, 222 and in main sec
        \item \textbf{Trade quantities} can vary if the usage is customary 
        within the trade---e.g., 4,000 shingles can really mean 2,500. 
        \emph{Hurst v.  W.J. Lake \& Co.}
        % TODO restatement 220, p. 410, and in main sec
        \item If one party is unaware of the trade usage, but should have 
        known, there is a fundamental difference in intent and thus no 
        contract. \emph{Flower City Painting Contractors, Inc. v. Gumina} 
        (following \emph{Raffles v. Wichelhaus}).

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Offer and Revocation}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Key concepts: \textbf{intent, clarity, revocation}.
    % todo restatement 24, 26
    % TODO ucc 2-328; and see Hoffman v. Horton and the following note on 
    % auctions (reserve rules)
    \item \textbf{Negotiation vs. firm offer}: there is an important 
    distinction between intent to find out if the other party is interested 
    and intent to make a definite offer. \emph{Lonergan v. Scolnick}.
    \item If a party reserves the right to not accept an offer, a proposal is 
    only an \textbf{invitation} to submit an offer. \emph{Regent Lighting 
    Corp. v. CMT Corp.}
    \item \textbf{Unilateral offer}: a binding obligation arises from 
    newspaper ads if ``the facts show that some performance was promised in 
    positive terms for something requested.''\footnote{Williston. Casebook p. 
    418.} ``~.~.~.~where the offer is \textbf{clear, definite, and explicit}, 
    and leaves nothing open for negotiation, it constitutes an offer, 
    acceptance of which will complete the contract.''\footnote{Casebook p. 
    419.} \emph{Lefkowitz v. Great Minneapolis Surplus Store}.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item But, courts have imposed limits---e.g., an ad offering 11\% 
        financing on a car does not constitute an offer because not everyone 
        will qualify for that rate. \emph{Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Russell}.
        \item Is a newspaper ad an offer or an invitation to negotiate? Courts 
        generally hold that it is an offer if it \textbf{requires the consumer to 
        perform a specific act} (e.g., first come, first served). But does 
        that align with consumers' reasonable expectations? Does traveling to 
        the store count as an act? \emph{Donovan v. RRL Corp.}
        \item Displaying something in a shop window with a price tag is an 
        invitation, not an offer. \emph{Fisher v. Bell}.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item People are not legally bound when they make appointments or 
    reservations.\footnote{Casebook p. 424.}
    \item ``An offer may be \textbf{terminated} in a number of ways, as, for 
    example, where it is \textbf{rejected} by the offeree, or where it is not 
    accepted by him within the \textbf{time fixed}, or, if no time is fixed, 
    within a \textbf{reasonable time}.  An offer terminated in either of these 
    ways ceases to exist and cannot therefore be accepted.''\footnote{Casebook 
    p. 427.} \emph{Akers v. J.B. Sedberry, Inc.}
    \item A \textbf{qualified acceptance}, subject to a condition, does not 
    create a contractual obligation if the other party does not satisfy the 
    condition---e.g., offering to buy a house only if the previous owners left 
    behind the furniture. \emph{Ardente v. Horan}.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If the conditional acceptance does not add any conditions to the 
        contract, but rather releases the offeror from an obligation, it is an 
        ordinary binding acceptance (not a conditional acceptance)---e.g., 
        buying land from a railroad but relieving the railroad from its 
        obligation to remove tracks from the land. \emph{Rhode Island Dep't of 
        Transp. v.  Providence \& Worcester R.R.}
        \item A grumbling acceptance is still an acceptance. ``The notation 
        amounted to no more than saying I don't like your offer, I don't think 
        it's right or fair, but I accept it. That and nothing 
        more.''\footnote{Casebook p. 435.} \emph{Price v. Oklahoma College of 
        Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery}.
        \item The condition is not part of the offer if the offeree's 
        acceptance does not depend on the condition---e.g., renewing a lease 
        with a request to build a cookroom. \emph{Culton v. Gilchrist}.
    \end{enumerate}
    % restatement 39 and illustration p. 434
    \item Under classical contract law, the \textbf{mirror image rule} held 
    that no contract was formed if the acceptance differed from the offer in 
    any way. Modern contract law has softened the rule in two ways:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item UCC \S\ 2-207---see below.
        \item Restatement Second \S\ 59: an acceptance containing additional 
        terms is binding if acceptance does not depend on the offeror's assent 
        to the additional terms.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item A seller can \textbf{renew an offer by implication}. 
    \emph{Livingstone v. Evans}.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item For instance---S: I'll sell for \$1,800. B: How about \$1,600? 
        S: Sorry, can't go any lower. B: Ok, then, \$1,800.
        \item S renewed the offer by implication.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Mistake and Unexpected Circumstances}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Unilateral mistake (mechanical error)}: courts will grant

    damages will not compensate the other party. See the Nolan Ryan baseball 
    card case. % TODO clarify

        \item % TODO restatement 154 (+153?)
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Mistakes in transcription}: if there is proof of an 
    agreement, courts will reform an error in transcription as long as ``there 
    has been no prejudicial change of position by the other party while 
    ignorant of the mistake.'' \emph{Travelers Ins. Co. v. Bailey}. But if the 
    parties purposely based the contract on an uncertain event, there will be 
    no reformation. \emph{Chimart Associates v. Paul}.
    \item \textbf{Tacit assumptions} are present in every contract.
    \item \textbf{Mutual mistake}: tacit or explicit assumptions in the 
    agreement turn out to be incorrect.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The \emph{Sherwood} rule held that a mistake excuses performance 
        when it relates to the ``substance'' or ``root'' of the contract, but 
        not if it relates to something peripheral. \emph{Sherwood v. Walker}. 
        But the \emph{Sherwood} rule was all but overruled shortly after. 
        \emph{Nester v. Michigan Land \& Iron Co.}
        \item \textbf{Impossibility}: when the parties' mistke renders 
        performance impossible, performance is excused. \emph{Griffith v. 
        Brymer}.
        \item If there was no fraud and neither party could have known about 
        the mistake, the parties cannot rescind the agreement. \emph{Wood v. 
        Boynton.}
        \item When the market price of an item depends on collective judgment 
        (e.g., fine art), there is no mistake if the collective judgment later 
        shifts (e.g., the art world discovers that a different artist painted 
        a piece). \emph{Firestone \& Parson, Inc. v. Union League of 
        Philadelphia}.
        \item ``~.~.~.~rescission is indicated when the mistaken belief 
        relates to a basic assumption of the parties upon which the contract 
        is made, and which materially affects the agreed performance of the 
        party.'' \emph{Lewanee County Board of Health v. Messerly}.
        \item The buyer's assumption of risk (e.g., through an as-is) clause 
        can enforce performance despite a mistake. But, some courts have held 
        that the buyer's assumption of risk os only relevant when the parties 
        were \emph{aware} of the possibility that they were wrong. 
        \emph{Beachcomber Coins, Inc. v. Boskett.}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Implied conditions}: when performance depends on the 
    continued existence of a person or thing, that person or thing is an 
    implied condition. When that person or thing perishes, performance is 
    excused. \emph{Taylor v. Caldwell} (the plaintiff could rescind the 
    contract because a concert hall burned down).
